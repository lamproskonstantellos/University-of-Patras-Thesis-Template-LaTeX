# Diploma Thesis Template – University of Patras (ECE)

This repository contains a **LaTeX template** for preparing a Diploma Thesis at the  
**Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras**.  

It is fully compatible with any LaTeX editor, but you **must use the XeLaTeX compiler** to support Greek and English text properly.

##  Repository Structure

```
├── main.tex              # Main thesis file (compile this one with XeLaTeX)
├── thesis.bib            # Bibliography file (BibTeX)
├── cover.pdf             # Cover page template (Greek & English)
├── figure.jpg            # Example figure
│
├── abstract-eng.tex      # English abstract
├── abstract-gr.tex       # Greek abstract
├── acknowledgements.tex  # Acknowledgments
├── introduction.tex      # Example chapter (Introduction)
│
└── README.md             # This file
```

You can extend this by creating more chapter `.tex` files (e.g., `chapter2.tex`, `results.tex`) and including them in `main.tex`.
